CSUN - COMP 484 Project. 

A web portal designed to let users create their sports profile. It will let users find a person who shares a common interest in sports activity and willing to play with them.

User will post an activity, by providing location and timing where the activity will be held. Other users can see the posted activities 
and can join the activity sharing common interest.

Similarly, user can also host an event and post the same on the web app, and find out how many interested people are there and also the 
area to cover so that maximum profit can be achieved.
